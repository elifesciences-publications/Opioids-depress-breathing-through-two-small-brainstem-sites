These scripts execute analyses in 'Opioids depress breathing through two small brainstem sites' (Bachmutsky et al. 2020, 10.7554/eLife.52694)  

All code is written in MATLAB. In order to use code, download or clone repository and add to MATLAB path. Within-function paths referencing locations of example data will have to be updated in order to run functions appropriately.  

Missing Example Extracellular Data:  
The 'In Vitro Extracellular Analysis Fig. 4' folder contains functions that reference example data files too large (exceeding 100 MB in size) to upload to the Github repository. Example data is therefore available upon request to the corresponding author (Kevin.Yackle@ucsf.edu) or first author (Iris.Bachmutsky@ucsf.edu).
